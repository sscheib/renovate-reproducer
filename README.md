## Role Variables

| variable                                     | default                      | required | description                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------           | :--------------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fd_files`                                   | unset                        | true     | Files to deploy. See below for an extended example how to define it            |
| `fd_quiet_assert`                            | `false`                      | false    | Whether to quiet the assert statements                                         |

## Variable `fd_files`

An extended example of only the `fd_files` variable is illustrated down below:

```yaml
fd_files:
  - src: 'sshd_motd'
    dest: '/etc/motd'
    owner: 'root'
    group: 'root'
    mode: '0644'

  - src: 'sshd_issue.net'
    dest: '/etc/issue.net'
    owner: 'root'
    group: 'root'
    mode: '0644'

  - content: >-
      This is my text
    dest: '/home/steffen/test'
    owner: 'steffen'
    group: 'steffen'
    mode: '0400'
```

The attributes `dest`, `owner`, `group` and `mode` are required as well as either `src` or `content`. These attributes are validated for their *existence*. The permission
attributes are deliberately enforced (although `ansible.builtin.copy` does not require them) to avoid accidental unsafe file deployments which have too broad permissions.
This way, a user needs to consciously decide to set broad permissions.

The variables are **not** validated whether they have the correct type, etc. The only validation is the aforementioned existence of the attributes.

This role supports all attributes of [`ansible.builtin.copy`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html) which are supported at
the time of this writing (04.02.2024).
